This project is based on the quantum energy teleportation (QET) protocol by Hotta. QET allows us to exchange energy between two parties Alice and Bob (labelled $A$ and $B$). Like quantum teleportation by Bennett et. al. for quantum information, QET can be accomplished using pre-shared entanglement and local operations and classical communication.
